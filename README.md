# HappyApp

#### _Unfortunately discontinued_

HappyApp is a "social media" app that digitalizes the sex-worker business.

The HappyApp is based on three different types of user accounts. The normal user, the sex-worker user and the "administrator of sex-workers". The normal enduser is subscription based and each variant of subscription allows the user book more or less sex-workers per month. The "administrator of sex-workers" can create a special type of account with a key which he or she receives from us. The administrator can then create accounts for his or her sex-workers and control their accounts and marketing in the app.

**Since the app is _discontinued_, there are no proper screenshots nor a video presentation available.**
