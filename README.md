# HappyApp

#### _Unfortunately discontinued_

HappyApp is a "social media" app that digitalizes the prositution business.

The HappyApp is based on three different types of user accounts. The normal user, the prostitute user and the "administrator of prostitutes". The normal enduser is subscription based and each variant of subscription allows the user book more or less prostitutes per month. The "administrator of prostitutes" can create a special type of account with a key which he or she recieves from us. The administrator can then create accounts for his or her prostitutes and control their accounts and marketing in the app.

**Since the app is __discontinued__, there are no proper screenshots nor a video presentation available.**
